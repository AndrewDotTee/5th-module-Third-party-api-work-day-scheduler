# 5th Module third party api work day scheduler
This is the 5th module for a 3rd party api work day 9am to 5pm scheduler.

## Objectives
This week's challenge entailed creating a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm). This app will run in the default browser of the user and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The starter code that was provided uses the Day.js which links to an external site library to work with date and time displaying on the actual website.

## User Story
> 'AS AN employee with a busy schedule,
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner,
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively.'

## Result
When the 9-5pm schedule planner is opened, the current time and date is shown at the top of the calendar, when the user scrolls down, they are presented with time blocks for the standard business hours of 9am to 5pm. The time blocks are colour coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future. When the user clicks into the time block, they are able to write what they like and can save the event with the save button to the right of the time block.
